        <h1>From Death to Destiny</h1>
        
        <p>Should a guy with addictions as well-publicized as <em>Danny Worsnop’s</em> really be starting his band’s new album with the line <em>You’re fucking crazy if you think that I’ll ever change?</em></p>
        
        <p>Well, that’s the first lyric heard on From <strong>Death To Destiny</strong>, and it’s the perfect beginning to an album that blurs the lines between solipsism and sociopathy, and between hedonism and nihilism, even as it throws metalcore, electronic music and a healthy dose of hair metal into a Pro Tools blender set on “awesome.” Yes, there are breakdowns and digital stutters and an electronic intro on this album, but that intro sounds more like late-’90s darkcore artists like Witchman or Panacea than dubstep or trance. The disc’s latter half sounds like it could have been recorded in 1989—and that’s a good thing. The album’s third track, <em>The Death Of Me</em>, is repeated at the end in a “rock mix” that strips away (most of) the electronics and death growls, leaving behind a melodic metal song in the vein of Killswitch Engage. <strong>Asking Alexandria</strong> was one of the first bands (along with <em>Attack Attack</em>) to create the infamous Risecore or Crabcore genre/sound. Alternating between constant chugging, simple breakdowns, clean choruses and the occasional trance beats, the genre quickly became popular with young people for its infectiousness and simplicity. For the others, it was annoying, incoherent, repetitive, fake and shallow music.

    </ol>        
    
        <p>Now releasing their third album, <strong>From Death To Destiny</strong>, Asking Alexandria is more or less trying to escape the genre they helped create in the first place (mainly by incorporating 80’s hard rock influences). While it doesn’t entirely work, it would be dishonest to say there aren’t headbanging riffs and memorable choruses here.
